# Project Summary

## Overview
This project aims to create a control system for a robotic arm using ODrive-based controllers. The system will include a backend to interface with the ODrive library and a frontend dashboard for user interaction.

## Architecture
- **Odrive/**: Contains the cloned ODrive repository for reference and code analysis.
- **Backend/**: Interfaces with the ODrive library.
- **Frontend/**: A React.js dashboard with TypeScript and Vite.
- **memlog/**: Contains project documentation and logs.

## Workflow
1. Clone the ODrive repository for reference.
2. Develop the backend to interface with the ODrive library.
3. Create a frontend dashboard using React.js.

## API Endpoints
- TBD

## Architectural Decisions
- Using React.js for the frontend to leverage its component-based architecture.
- Cloning the ODrive repository for direct access to the source code.
